- 👋 Hi, I’m @hbarudi
- 👀 I’m interested in ... making high performance applications.
High performance meaning use all possible cpu and gpu cores to run as fast as possible on any hardware.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... python and kivy as modern high performance applications can use this framework but apple discontinuing
opengl es that kivy uses for its high performance capabilites is down and hope kivy can move to this new technology vulkan with metal support to make sure that we can
still support apple products in the future.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... making 2 applications to learn about the code
The first one is optical matrix calculations for evaluating solar cell external quantum efficincy
The second one is to make a minecraft style game.
