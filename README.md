- 👋 Hi, I’m @hbarudi
- 👀 I’m interested in ... making high performance applications.
High performance meaning use all possible cpu and gpu cores to run as fast as possible on any hardware.
Also learned python and django for web applications and can do c++ rust java and almost all the languages.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... vulkan api for high performance applications.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... making 2 applications to learn about the code
The first one is optical matrix calculations for evaluating solar cell external quantum efficincy
The second one is to make a minecraft style game.
